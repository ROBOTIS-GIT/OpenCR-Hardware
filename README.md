# OpenCR: Open Source Control Module for ROS
OpenCR (Open-source Control Module for ROS) was developed for ROS embedded systems to provide completely open-source hardware and software.

# OpenCR-Hardware
Everything about the board; Schematics, PCB Gerber, BOM and the firmware source code for the TurtleBot3 and OP3 are free to distribute under open-source licenses for users and the ROS community. The STM32F7 series chip inside the OpenCR1.0 board is based on a very powerful ARM Cortex-M7 with a floating point unit. The development environment for OpenCR1.0 is widely open from the Arduino IDE and Scratch for young students to the traditional firmware development for the experts.
